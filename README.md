# Anesthesia-Default
Anesthesia-1.20.4 default instance

# Installation Instructions
1. Click "code" on the top right, and download zip.
2. Open your modded Minecraft launcher of choice(PrismLauncher is recommended).
3. Create a Fabric 1.20.4 instance.
4. Extract the zip file, and copy the .minecraft folder inside to the folder of the 1.20.4 Fabric instance; delete the existing .minecraft folder if one is already present.

".minecraft" might be a hidden directory, use ctrl+h to show hidden directories.

# Optional bonus
1. Download the "DistantHorizons.sqlite" file.
2. Open Minecraft and join Anesthesia.
3. Leave the server, then replace the "DistantHorizons.sqlite" file under ".minecraft/Distant_Horizons_server_data/<server_name>/overworld/DistantHorizons.sqlite".

This will have many of the chunks already loaded for you, so can take advantage of the modded 200 chunk render distance, without having to explore those areas first.
